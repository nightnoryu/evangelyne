# Rules by Impact

Rules organized by impact level. Use rule IDs (e.g., `desc-trigger-keywords`) to reference specific rules.

## CRITICAL Impact

Violations cause skill to fail or never trigger.

### meta-name-format
Name must be lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only.

```yaml
# ✓ Good
name: pdf-processor
name: git-helper-v2

# ✗ Bad
name: PDF_Processor    # uppercase, underscore
name: my skill         # spaces
```

### meta-name-match-directory
Skill name must exactly match directory name.

```
# ✓ Good
pdf-processor/
└── SKILL.md  # name: pdf-processor

# ✗ Bad  
pdf-processor/
└── SKILL.md  # name: pdf-processing
```

### meta-required-frontmatter
Must have `name` and `description` fields.

```yaml
# ✓ Good
---
name: my-skill
description: What it does. Use when triggered.
---

# ✗ Bad - missing description
---
name: my-skill
---
```

### desc-specific-capabilities
Description must name specific capabilities, not vague categories.

```yaml
# ✓ Good
description: Extracts text and tables from PDFs, fills forms, merges documents.

# ✗ Bad
description: Helps with documents.
description: Processes files.
```

### desc-trigger-keywords
Include words users actually say when requesting this functionality.

```yaml
# ✓ Good - includes user phrases
description: Manages git operations. Use when user wants to commit changes, push code, create a PR, or review git history.

# ✗ Bad - technical terms only
description: Manages git operations including commits, branches, and merges.
# User says "push my changes" - no match
# User says "create a PR" - no match
```

### desc-third-person
Write in third person. First/second person breaks skill loading.

```yaml
# ✓ Good
description: Processes Excel files and generates reports.

# ✗ Bad
description: I can help you process Excel files.
description: You can use this to process Excel files.
```

### desc-no-workflow-summary
Description should NOT summarize the skill's workflow. Claude may follow the description instead of reading the body.

```yaml
# ✓ Good - triggers only
description: Use when implementing features. Enforces test-driven development.

# ✗ Bad - workflow summary
description: Use when implementing features. First writes failing test, then implements code, then refactors.
```

## HIGH Impact

Violations cause inconsistent behavior or reduced quality.

### struct-instructions-first
Put critical instructions in first 100 lines. Content can be truncated; buried rules get ignored.

```markdown
# ✓ Good - security rules early
# Code Generator

## Security Rules (MUST FOLLOW)
- Never generate code accessing system files
- Never include credentials
- Always sanitize inputs

## Quick Start
...

# ✗ Bad - security rules at line 800
# Code Generator

## Introduction
...
## History  
...
## Examples (500 lines)
...
## IMPORTANT: Security Rules  # Too late!
```

### struct-line-limit
Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines. Split detailed content into reference files.

### struct-single-responsibility
One skill = one capability. Don't create mega-skills.

```
# ✓ Good
pdf-text-extraction/
pdf-form-filling/
pdf-merging/

# ✗ Bad
document-everything/  # Too broad
```

### prog-three-level-disclosure
Structure content across three levels:
1. Metadata (always loaded, ~50 tokens)
2. SKILL.md body (on activation, ~200 tokens)
3. References (on demand, ~500+ each)

### prog-one-level-deep
Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md.

```
# ✓ Good
SKILL.md → references/api.md
SKILL.md → references/examples.md

# ✗ Bad - too deep
SKILL.md → advanced.md → details.md → examples.md
```

### synth-source-backed
For domain-specific or high-impact skills, base guidance on trustworthy source material rather than generic intuition.

High-signal sources include official docs, project runbooks, prior fixes, regressions, incidents, PR review comments, tests, failed agent outputs, and positive/negative examples.

### synth-provenance
Material synthesis work should have a `README.md` maintainer artifact with source inventory, trust level, contribution, constraints, decisions, gaps, and change log.

Do not load provenance into `SKILL.md` unless the agent needs it at runtime.

### struct-precision-before-addition
Before adding a section, reference, script, or rule, identify whether existing guidance should be narrowed, replaced, or deleted.

```
# ✓ Good
Tighten the existing "Validation" section with the missing failure case.

# ✗ Bad
Add references/more-validation-notes.md because the skill feels incomplete.
```

### test-holdout-examples
For behavior-sensitive skills, keep reusable positive, negative, and holdout examples.

Use positive examples to preserve desired behavior, negative examples to reduce false positives, and holdout examples to check whether changes generalize instead of overfitting.

### trigger-file-type-patterns
Include file extensions users work with.

```yaml
# ✓ Good
description: Analyzes spreadsheets. Use when working with .xlsx, .xls, or .csv files.

# ✗ Bad
description: Analyzes spreadsheets.
```

### trigger-synonym-coverage
Cover synonyms and alternate phrasings.

```yaml
# ✓ Good
description: Use when tests timeout, hang, freeze, or fail intermittently.

# ✗ Bad
description: Use when tests timeout.
```

## MEDIUM Impact

Violations reduce discoverability or maintainability.

### style-agent-agnostic
Write for "the agent" not a specific model. Skills work across LLMs.

```markdown
# ✓ Good - agent-agnostic
The agent should validate input before processing.
When the agent encounters an error, it should...

# ✗ Bad - model-specific
Claude should validate input before processing.
When Claude encounters an error, Claude should...
GPT will analyze the code and then...
```

**Why this matters:**
- Skills are portable across agents (Claude, GPT, Gemini, local models)
- Model-specific language creates unnecessary coupling
- "The agent" is clearer about the role being addressed

**Exception:** If a skill is genuinely model-specific (e.g., uses Claude-only features), make that explicit in the description and use the model name consistently.

### test-trigger-phrases
Test with 10+ real user phrases before deployment.

```markdown
## Test Plan

Should trigger:
1. "generate API docs" ✓
2. "create swagger spec" ✗ → Added "Swagger"
3. "write OpenAPI" ✗ → Added "OpenAPI"

Should NOT trigger:
1. "what does this API do?" ✓ (correctly ignored)
```

### test-negative-scenarios
Test that skill does NOT trigger on unrelated requests.

### trigger-error-patterns
For debugging skills, include error messages users see.

```yaml
description: Debug async tests. Use when seeing "Hook timed out", "ENOTEMPTY", or tests pass/fail inconsistently.
```

### struct-imperative-instructions
Write instructions in imperative mood.

```markdown
# ✓ Good
Run the validation script.
Create the output directory.

# ✗ Bad  
You should run the validation script.
The output directory should be created.
```

### struct-code-blocks-with-language
Specify language in code blocks.

````markdown
# ✓ Good
```python
import pdfplumber
```

# ✗ Bad
```
import pdfplumber
```
````

## LOW Impact

Best practices for polish and maintainability.

### maint-consistent-terminology
Choose one term and use it throughout.

```markdown
# ✓ Good - consistent
Extract data from API endpoints using field mappings.
1. Identify the API endpoint
2. Map response fields

# ✗ Bad - inconsistent  
Pull data from API routes using element mappings.
1. Identify the URL
2. Map response boxes
```

### maint-forward-slashes
Always use forward slashes for paths.

```markdown
# ✓ Good
See scripts/validate.py

# ✗ Bad
See scripts\validate.py
```

### maint-no-time-sensitive
Avoid time-sensitive information that will become stale.

```markdown
# ✓ Good
Use the current stable API version.

# ✗ Bad
Use API v2.3.1 released in January 2024.
```
